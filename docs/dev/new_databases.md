Based on your goal of Visual Excellence, I have researched the best free APIs available. Here are the top candidates for other media types:

1. Cinema & TV (Top Recommendation)
   API: The Movie Database (TMDB)

Pros: Best-in-class assets. Provides high-resolution posters, backdrops, and actor photos.
Visuals: Extremely high quality. This is the industry standard for community apps.
Cost: Free for non-commercial use.
Why: Movies have iconic visuals that look great in a tier list. 

2. Video Games
API: IGDB (Internet Game Database)

Pros: The "gold standard" for game data (owned by Twitch).
Visuals: Excellent cover art and screenshots.
Cons: Requires a Twitch Developer account and OAuth flow (slightly more complex setup than an open API).
Alternative: RAWG.io is easier to set up (simple API key) but has slightly lower quality consistency. 

3. Anime & Manga
API: Jikan (Unofficial MyAnimeList API)
Pros: Completely free, open-source, no authentication required.
Visuals: Good quality cover art from MyAnimeList.
Why: Very easy to integrate.
Alternative: Anilist (GraphQL) is more modern but might be overkill for just fetching images. 

4. Books
API: Google Books API

Pros: Massive database.
Visuals: Book covers are often lower resolution than movie posters, but coverage is huge.
Why: Reliable and easy to use.
